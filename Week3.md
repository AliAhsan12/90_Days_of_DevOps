# What is required DevOps Behaviors?
DevOps behaviors refer to a set of cultural and operational practices that enable organizations to achieve continuous delivery and deployment of software products. The following are some key requirements for DevOps behaviors:

1)	Collaboration: DevOps requires collaboration between different teams involved in software development, including developers, operations, and quality assurance. It is essential to have open communication channels and shared ownership of software development and deployment.

2)	Continuous integration and delivery: DevOps practices require automated and continuous integration and delivery of software. This means that software changes are continuously integrated, tested, and deployed to production in a streamlined manner.

3)	Agile methodologies: DevOps is based on Agile methodologies, which emphasize iterative development, continuous feedback, and collaboration between teams.

4)	Automation: DevOps practices require the automation of software development, testing, and deployment processes. This includes the use of tools and technologies such as continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, configuration management, and infrastructure automation.

5)	Monitoring and feedback: DevOps practices require continuous monitoring and feedback of software in production. This enables teams to identify issues and make improvements quickly, reducing the time between deployments.

6)	Continuous learning and improvement: DevOps practices require a culture of continuous learning and improvement. This includes regular retrospectives and post-mortems to identify areas for improvement, as well as experimentation and innovation to drive ongoing optimization of software development and deployment processes.
