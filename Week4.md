These resources are available on-demand, and customers can easily scale them up or down based on their needs. Additionally, cloud providers offer a variety of compute options, such as general-purpose, memory-optimized, and compute-optimized instances, to cater to different workload requirements.

Storage: Cloud infrastructure also provides a variety of storage options to store and manage data, such as object storage, block storage, and file storage. These storage options are designed to be highly scalable, durable, and available, providing customers with the flexibility to store and manage data based on their needs.

Overall, cloud infrastructure provides customers with a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to access computing resources and services. By leveraging cloud infrastructure, organizations can focus on their core business and leave the underlying infrastructure management to the cloud provider.

# Virtualization in Cloud and how virtualization in cloud works?

Virtualization is a fundamental technology used in cloud computing that enables the creation of virtual resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), virtual storage, and virtual networks, on top of physical infrastructure. This allows multiple virtual resources to run on the same physical hardware, which can be shared by multiple users or applications.

In cloud computing, virtualization plays a critical role in enabling the dynamic allocation of computing resources to customers on-demand. Virtualization in the cloud works by abstracting the underlying physical hardware and creating virtualized resources that can be allocated to customers based on their needs.

Here's how virtualization in the cloud works:

Hypervisor: A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is installed on the physical hardware and is responsible for creating and managing virtual resources.

Virtual Machines: Virtual machines are created by the hypervisor, which allocates a portion of the physical hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to the VM. Each VM is isolated from other VMs and runs its own operating system and applications.

Virtual Networks: Virtual networks are created by the hypervisor to connect the VMs to each other and to the internet. These networks are software-defined and can be configured to provide different levels of isolation and security.

Virtual Storage: Virtual storage is created by the hypervisor to provide disk space to the VMs. This storage can be allocated from a pool of shared physical storage, allowing customers to pay only for the storage they use.

Overall, virtualization in the cloud enables cloud providers to offer customers a highly flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to access computing resources. By abstracting the underlying physical hardware, virtualization enables customers to easily scale up or down their computing resources, as well as reduce the cost of hardware and infrastructure management.


# Cloud Security and threats

Cloud security is a critical aspect of cloud computing, as organizations store sensitive and confidential data in the cloud. The shared nature of cloud computing, where multiple customers share the same infrastructure, creates a unique set of security challenges that must be addressed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data in the cloud. Some of the common security threats in the cloud include:

1) Data breaches: Cloud data breaches occur when an unauthorized party gains access to sensitive data stored in the cloud. This can happen due to weak passwords, misconfigured security settings, or vulnerabilities in the cloud provider's infrastructure.

2) Insider threats: Insider threats occur when an authorized user, such as an employee or contractor, intentionally or unintentionally compromises the security of the cloud. This can happen due to malicious intent, negligence, or lack of security awareness.

3) Malware: Malware is a type of software that is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. Malware can infect cloud resources through phishing emails, unpatched software, or malicious downloads.

4) Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: DoS attacks occur when a malicious actor floods a cloud resource with traffic to disrupt its normal operation. DoS attacks can impact the availability of cloud resources and cause downtime for customers.

5) Account hijacking: Account hijacking occurs when an attacker gains access to a legitimate user's credentials and uses them to access cloud resources. This can happen due to weak passwords, phishing attacks, or stolen credentials.

To mitigate these threats, cloud providers employ a variety of security measures, such as data encryption, access control, network segmentation, and intrusion detection and prevention systems. Additionally, customers must implement best practices for cloud security, such as using strong passwords, implementing multi-factor authentication, regularly monitoring cloud resources, and educating employees on security awareness. By working together, cloud providers and customers can ensure the security of data in the cloud and prevent security breaches and attacks.


# Types of Storage on cloud

Cloud computing offers various types of storage services that provide customers with a scalable, durable, and cost-effective way to store and manage data. The following are the different types of storage available on the cloud:

1) Object Storage: Object storage is a scalable and durable storage service that is ideal for storing unstructured data, such as documents, images, and videos. Object storage provides a simple, flat structure for storing and retrieving data and is accessible via a web-based interface or API. Some examples of object storage services include Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.

2) Block Storage: Block storage is a high-performance storage service that is designed for storing structured data, such as databases and virtual machine disks.
